ChatGPT Shell Script
---
`ch` is a POSIX-compliant shell script/library:
- Access ChatGPT from your terminal, no more context switching to browser tabs.
- Integrate ChatGPT requests with standard shell tools like pipes, redirects and grep.
- Source `ch` in your own shell scripts to use it as a library. See `tests/run.sh` for an example.

### System Requirements
1. An operating system with a POSIX-compatible shell. Tested on: Linux, MacOS, BSD, Android (via Termux).
2. A valid OpenAI ChatGPT API key. Create one at OpenAI.
3. The curl and jq utilities to be installed.
4. An Internet connection.

### Usage
    ch [Option]
    
    Options
      a|again            in case of error, send current chat again
      c|current <title>  switch the current chat to a differerent title
      g|gen              generate title for current chat
      h|help             print this help
      p|print            print out the current chat
      l|list             list all chat titles
      n|new <prompt>     start a new chat
      r|reply <reply>    reply to the current chat
      t|title            print the current chat title
    
      Arguments in <angle brackets> are read from STDIN if not present.

### Example
    $ ./ch n is it possible to '"delete"' lines of output in a terminal, or simulate it using ANSI escape sequences?
    Yes, it is possible to "delete" lines of output in a terminal or simulate it using ANSI escape sequences.
    
    Here's an example of how you can simulate deleting lines in a terminal using ANSI escape sequences in Python:
    ...

I also recorded a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aYUvLeM0yo) with more background on the rationale for
`ch` and example uses.

ยน Depends on usage, in my case I went from spending $20 to less than $2 per month.
